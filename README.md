# README

TL;DR: Automatic commit messages sourced as inspiring quotes to keep you coding.

## What Is This

Every now and then, we need some inspiration to keep pushing through a challenging coding problem.
I was writing inspiring quotes as commit messages on a recent feature and I thought...
'I'm a software engineer, I shouldn't have to do this myself'
... and commitspiration was born.

### Installation Instructions

1. Clone repo
2. npm install
3. npm link

### Usage

1. Stage your changes
2. `cminspo commit` to commit with an inspiring quote
3. `cminspo quote` to just get a quote logged to terminal with no commit
4. Enjoy.

If you just want a random inspiration quote without committing, try `cminspo quote`
